# Rust File Lister ⚡

A lightning-fast file listing utility written in Rust, inspired by `ls`, `lsd`, and `exa`. Display directory contents in a beautiful grid with file type icons, permissions, and color-coded output.

## Description

This high-performance file listing tool provides:
- **Lightning-fast directory traversal** optimized for speed
- **Beautiful grid layout** that adapts to your terminal width
- **File type icons** for instant visual recognition (🦀 for Rust, 📁 for directories, etc.)
- **Octal permissions display** (644, 755, etc.)
- **Owner and group information** with color coding
- **Intelligent sorting** (directories first, then alphabetical)
- **Cross-platform terminal support** with colors

## Prerequisites

- Rust programming language (latest stable version recommended)
- Cargo (comes with Rust installation)
- Unix-like system (Linux, macOS) for file permissions

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory

## Usage

To compile and run the file lister:

```bash
cargo run
```

To compile for production use:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be available at `target/release/rusttest`

## Features

### 🎨 Visual Elements
- **File Type Icons**: Instant recognition with emojis
  - 🦀 Rust files (.rs)
  - 🐍 Python files (.py) 
  - ⚡ JavaScript/TypeScript (.js, .ts)
  - 📁 Directories
  - 📝 Markdown files (.md)
  - 🖼️ Images (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.)
  - And many more!

### 🎯 Performance
- **Zero-allocation file type detection**
- **Efficient memory usage**
- **Adaptive grid layout**
- **Graceful error handling**

### 🌈 Color Coding
- **Blue Bold**: Directory names
- **Yellow**: File permissions  
- **Green**: Owner names
- **Cyan**: Group names

## Example Output

```
📂 /home/user/projects/rusttest (6 items)

📁 755 user user src/           🦀 644 user user main.rs        
⚙️ 644 user user Cargo.toml    📝 644 user user README.md      
📝 644 user user project-plan.md   ⚙️ 755 user user hello_world
```
